The xlsx file of velocity are calculated from time.xlsx file. Both files are used to construct the machine learning model for the 100m sprint velocity curve. The file of "1121015.py" is our main script for forming the machine learning model, calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, and plotting the velocity development graph of each data. The correlation.py script help calculating the predicted data from the model for comparison with each actual data.
